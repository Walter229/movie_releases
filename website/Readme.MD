<h1 Structure>
In this file structure, the app.py file is the main entry point for the Flask application. It defines the Flask app and sets up the routing, templates, and database connections. 
The templates directory contains the HTML templates for the different views of the website, and the static directory contains the CSS stylesheets and images used on the website.
The models directory contains the classes and methods for managing the data for the website, using an ORM like SQLAlchemy. 
The routes directory contains the functions and methods that are called when a user accesses a specific URL on the website. 
Finally, the config.py file contains any configuration settings for the Flask app, such as the database connection details and the app's secret key.
